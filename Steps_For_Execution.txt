										STEPS FOR EXECUTION OF THIS PROJECT ARE GIVEN BELOW


METHORD I:

Step1: install all the dependencies to global level from requirements file
command: pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 2: To run Server 
command: python server.py

Step 3: To run Client 
command: python client.py			// (client will ask Ip address of the server which you will get after running the server file)



METHORD II: (running in virtual environment)

Step1: To install virtual environment
command: pip install virtualenv

Step2: Creating a virtual environment in that folder (present working directory)
syntax: python -m virtualenv <name of the environment>			//(The name can be anything you want)	eg: test
command: python -m virtualenv test

Step3: For running the virtual environment; if you have run the command above command as 
Syntax: ./<file_name>/Scripts/activate
Command: ./test/Scripts/activate			// to activate the virtualenv

Step4: Whatever you install now will be loaded to this environment folder
command: pip install -r requirements.txt			//To install the dependencies

Step 5: To run Server 
command: python server.py

Step 6: To run Client 
command: python client.py			// (client will ask Ip address of the server which you will get after running the server file)
	
	
	
												GENERAL POINT FOR THIS PROJECT ARE


(1)	before running make sure to create a file named as "server_files".

(2)	put some (image, text, video file "not too big otherwise it will take more time too load depending on network connection" ) to show list of content in client side when you connect to server.

(3)	If file not present then Server will ask you write some comment which will be stored on "server_files" folder in test format.
	I have included a screenshot of this case in case you need. 

(4)	In method II you are creating a virtual environment to run your project; so whatever you install all will be installed in the PWD (present working directory)
	don't for get to activate your virtual environment each time when you run your program.  
	./test/Scripts/activate
