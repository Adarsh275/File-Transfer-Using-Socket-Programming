# Socket-Programming
In this project, which is based on socket programming one end user becomes (Server) and another becomes (Client).  Server sends requested files to Client in multiple format (mp4,txt,png,jpeg) and if file is not present in server then server ask client to type a message(requested file name) to client and save it as text file on Server so that it can be made available in Future.
